Personal is a modern and bold website template suited perfectly for a UI/UX Design professional's portfolio.

The original PSD is included and was provided by [Web Donut](http://webdonut.net)

This project was developed with HTML5, Sass, jQuery, TweenLite, and ScrollMagic.

Performance basics are covered: assets are minified into single CSS and JS files, and the images are optimized.
